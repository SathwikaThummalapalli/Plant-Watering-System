# Plant-Watering-System
An automated watering system is developed to optimize the use of water for plants and verify water scarcity problem. It is difficult to manually assess the amount of moisture required in the soil for the healthy growth of plants therefore the soil is either left dry for a long period of time, or flooded unnecessarily hence both destroy the nutrients and minerals from the soil that are vital for the plants. .In area where low rain occurs or in case of inadequate rain take place, irrigation becomes difficult. The need to automated for proper water supply and reduce time and. So, efficient water management makes an important role in the irrigated systems. This project is to design and develop a low cost system which is based on water irrigation system using Arduino board. This project uses soil moisture sensors to detect the water quantity present in agriculture field.The 
aim of the implementation was to demonstrate that the water irrigation can be used to reduce water use.
